Oh yes! If you use the same password everywhere, let me tell you my friend, it is quite easy to hack your account.\n\nBreach happens on site A, leads to you getting hacked on other websites.\n\n\u003e I used to use the same password everywhere in the good old days. Came across [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)  and it revealed how many breaches my email has been part of, instantly started using password manager.\n\u003e \n\u003e A few years later I received a spam email, and it contained my old breached password, and they were trying to blackmail me to send them bitcoins. But I had already made a move from that password by then. 🙃\n\n1Password's integrations are amazing! There's also developer API to connect and get secrets from the password store. I can store all my secrets in there and serve up the secrets right to my applications. No need to set up [Vault by HashiCorp](https://www.vaultproject.io/), at least for simple hacks.\n\nSome Alternatives,\n\nLastPass has been part of a breach lately.\n\nApple's Keychain is good, but only if you are heavily integrated into the Apple ecosystem. It doesn't have an authenticator, and great out of the box integrations with browsers.\n\n# Github Copilot 🦾\n\nIf you are heavily integrated into VSCode as I am, then it is a must-buy subscription.\n\nChatGPT is much more powerful, but ChatGPT requires you to context switch from your IDE to browser, not very convenient. \n\nThe recent launch of CopilotX is revolutionary. 90% of my code is being written by Copilot nowadays. With CopilotX you have access to a ChatGPT like interface with a click of a shortcut. CopilotX knows the file that you are coming from and if you ask it some question, it provides answer based on the context you came in from.\n\nYou are bound to be surprised! 🤯\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-06-11T17:23:39.771910521Z","tags":[]},"/Who-dis":{"title":"Who dis? 🤔","content":"\n\nHello, Rhitik here! 👋🏼\n\nFirst things first, I use avatars for identity.
