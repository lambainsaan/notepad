Oh yes! If you use the same password everywhere, let me tell you my friend, it is quite easy to hack your account.\n\nBreach happens on site A, leads to you getting hacked on other websites.\n\n\u003e I used to use the same password everywhere in the good old days. Came across [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)  and it revealed how many breaches my email has been part of, instantly started using password manager.\n\u003e \n\u003e A few years later I received a spam email, and it contained my old breached password, and they were trying to blackmail me to send them bitcoins. But I had already made a move from that password by then. 🙃\n\n1Password's integrations are amazing! There's also developer API to connect and get secrets from the password store. I can store all my secrets in there and serve up the secrets right to my applications. No need to set up [Vault by HashiCorp](https://www.vaultproject.io/), at least for simple hacks.\n\nSome Alternatives,\n\nLastPass has been part of a breach lately.\n\nApple's Keychain is good, but only if you are heavily integrated into the Apple ecosystem. It doesn't have an authenticator, and great out of the box integrations with browsers.\n\n# Github Copilot 🦾\n\nIf you are heavily integrated into VSCode as I am, then it is a must-buy subscription.\n\nChatGPT is much more powerful, but ChatGPT requires you to context switch from your IDE to browser, not very convenient. \n\nThe recent launch of CopilotX is revolutionary. 90% of my code is being written by Copilot nowadays. With CopilotX you have access to a ChatGPT like interface with a click of a shortcut. CopilotX knows the file that you are coming from and if you ask it some question, it provides answer based on the context you came in from.\n\nYou are bound to be surprised! 🤯\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-06-12T03:39:45.516575886Z","tags":[]},"/Training-My-First-AI-Model":{"title":"Training my first AI Model 🤖","content":"\nLet me take you on a journey through training of an AI model.\n\n# Problem Statement\n\nI am building [[Conversation Copilot]], one of the features I am targeting in v1 is tracking of followup on a message.\n\nAt times, you need to follow up on messages, let's say I had a conversation with my manager.\n\n\u003e Rhitik: Summer is coming, can we install a water cooler installed at the premises?\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e Roshan:  Let me check with some vendors and get back to you.\n\u003e *crickets* end of the day passes\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e 🦗 *crickets* 🦗 \n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e summer arrives\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e Rhitik: Hey Rosh, do we have any update on the water cooler conversation?\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e Roshan: Oh shucks totally forgot about it.

It would be a good idea to update him about the same.*\n\nI am training a model to understand what messages requires followups.\n\nAs the title suggests this is my first dig at training a model. I don't have very high expectations. But journey of thousand miles begins with a single step.\n\n**This is my first step!**\n\nWhat we will be doing?\n\n1. Figure out a data source.\n2. Bring in the data.\n3. Clean up data and prepare for training.\n4. Train model.\n5. Evaluate.\n6. Loop back to 3 if we are not getting above 90% accuracy\n\n\n## Figuring out data source\n\nWhat kind of data I want?\n\n**Criteria for data**\n1. Concise conversations - I don't want to train the model on emails. Because my end goal is to use it on slack data.\n2. Non-automated - I don't want conversations with chatbots.\n3. Multi-user - I want multiple users to be part of the data.\n4. Threaded - What is being replied to should be apparent from data.\n\n**Data Discovery**\nImmediately, I thought of using some of the discord/slack community's data that I am part of. But I didn't have access to install an app to get the data out of those communities.\n","lastmodified":"2023-06-12T03:39:45.516575886Z","tags":[]},"/Who-dis":{"title":"Who dis? 🤔","content":"\n\nHello, Rhitik here! 👋🏼\n\nFirst things first, I use avatars for identity.
