Once I have a working solution, I must reach out to the Buyers. So let's keep Buyers in the backlog for now.\n\nI have some friends whose companies use Slack.

This token needs to be regenerated every once in a while because of expiry. And when the day comes and the token expires, the CI pipeline starts failing.\n\nThis has happened a couple of times over the past few months when my token went stale and my CI pipelines started going haywire as a result.\n\nI can update my token by going to the github settings every once in a while, but I thought it would be better if I would integrate 1Password directly into the CI pipeline. If I integrate 1Password into the tooling, then it would be easier to manage the secrets, because I use 1Password for all my credentials, and it can remind me when the creds are expiring, plus I don't have to navigate into github to change the secrets.\n\nAnd so that's what Rhitik did yesterday, he integrated 1Password in the github action.\n\nSteps are pretty straightforward,\n\n1. Create a new vault on 1Password, put your secret there. [Create vaults](https://support.1password.com/create-share-vaults/#:~:text=all%20your%20devices.-,To%20create%20a%20vault%2C%20tap%20Items%2C%20then%20tap%20New%20Vault,Give%20your%20vault%20a%20name.)\n2. Create a service account on 1password and give it access to the vault you just created in last step. [1Password Service Accounts](https://developer.1password.com/docs/service-accounts/)\n3. Then comes creation of a new secret in your repo, `OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN` which contains the token generated in the last step. [Using secrets in GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions)\n4. Integrate 1Password action into github action to fetch token from your 1Password vault.\n\n```yaml\n# github-action.yaml\n# other steps ...\n      - name: Configure 1Password Service Account\n        uses: 1password/load-secrets-action/configure@v1\n        with:\n          service-account-token: ${{ secrets.OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN }}\n\n      - name: Load secret\n        id: load-secret\n        uses: 1password/load-secrets-action@v1\n        with:\n          export-env: false\n        env:\n          GITHUB_NOTEPAD_RAW_TOKEN: op://app-cicd/hello-world/secret\n\n      - name: Print masked secret\n        run: echo \"Secret: ${{ steps.load-secret.outputs.GITHUB_NOTEPAD_RAW_TOKEN }}\"\n\n# other steps ...\n```\n\n\nMuch verbose documentation for the same from 1Password, [Load secrets from 1Password into GitHub Actions](https://developer.1password.com/docs/ci-cd/github-actions/)","lastmodified":"2023-11-03T13:28:26.38332329Z","tags":[]},"/Learning-In-Public":{"title":"Learning In Public","content":"| Topic                  | Why am I learning this? | Referenced Content |\n| ---------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------ |\n| NLP Feature Extraction | Need to learn feature extraction because I am building                        |                    |","lastmodified":"2023-11-03T13:28:26.38332329Z","tags":[]},"/Learning-Nuxt-3":{"title":"Learning Nuxt 3","content":"I'm currently working on [[building-in-public-md#public/Open Sourcing Governance Open Sourcing Governance|Open Sourcing Governance]] a project that will include documents like a manifesto.

A security company going through a breach is not acceptable. I have used it in the past when it was free, but I don't think the integrations are as good as 1Password's and so I chose 1Password.\n\nApple's Keychain is good, but only if you are heavily integrated into the Apple ecosystem.

With CopilotX you have access to a ChatGPT like interface with a click of a shortcut. CopilotX knows the file that you are coming from and if you ask it some question, it provides answer based on the context you came in from.\n\nYou are bound to be surprised! ü§Ø\n\n# Waking Up\n\nIt was eve time and I was in Gurgaon, the sun was setting in, and as usual I asked alexa to play the latest [Tim Ferris Show]() episode.

And there are some other teachers as well, but I have not taken other courses yet.\n\nI have found some meditations hard, like meditation around headlessness, they ask you to look at the world and then look at self--for some reason I am not able to make the switch. Which means I am still early on in the process, and there is a lot to learn.\n\nThere is a section around conversations, that is my favourite part. You can think of these as podcasts, with Sam Harris as host and a guest. These guests are informed people, talking about topics ranging from Health, Time Management, Productivity, Consciousness, the list goes on.\n\nThey have divided the app into three parts, Theory, Practice, and Life.\n\nI think we all need some care of our beautiful minds.\n\nI invite you to join Waking Up with me.\n\n[Waking Up with Sam Harris - Free 30-Day Trial](https://dynamic.wakingup.com/shareOpenAccess/SC07A7834)\n\nIf you can't afford the subscription, you are still welcome, we all need care for our minds.

Let me explain both concepts and provide examples for better understanding.\n**Getters**:\n- Getters are functions that return a value based on some other reactive data. They are defined using the `ref` function.\n- Getters are useful when you want to calculate or manipulate a value based on other reactive properties, and you want to access the value like a normal property.\n\nHere's an example of using a getter:\n```js\nimport { ref } from 'vue';\n\n// Define a reactive property\nconst count = ref(0);\n\n// Define a getter function\nconst doubleCount = () =\u003e count.value * 2;\n\n// Usage\nconsole.log(doubleCount()); // Access the value using the getter\n```\n\n\nIn this example, `doubleCount` is a getter that calculates the double of the `count` reactive property. You can access its value by calling it like a function.\n\n**Computed Properties**:\n- Computed properties are values that are automatically updated whenever the reactive dependencies they rely on change. They are defined using the `computed` function.\n- Computed properties are useful when you want to create a new reactive value based on other reactive properties, and you want it to automatically update when those dependencies change.\n\nHere's an example of using a computed property:\n\n```js\nimport { ref, computed } from 'vue';\n\n// Define a reactive property\nconst count = ref(0);\n\n// Define a computed property\nconst doubleCount = computed(() =\u003e count.value * 2);\n\n// Usage\nconsole.log(doubleCount.value); // Access the value like a property\n```\n\nIn this example, `doubleCount` is a computed property that calculates the double of the `count` reactive property. You can access its value using the `.value` property.\n\nThe recommendation to use getters (`() =\u003e value`) over computed (`computed(() =\u003e value)`) typically comes from a performance perspective. Getters are often more efficient when you only need to calculate a value once based on other reactive properties, while computed properties are better suited for values that need to automatically update whenever their dependencies change.\n\nSo, if you have a simple calculation or transformation to perform on reactive data, it's recommended to use a getter. If you need a value that automatically updates based on reactive dependencies, then you should use a computed property.\n\n### Setting dynamic titles\n\n`nuxt.config`¬†does not allow the page title to be dynamic. Therefore, it is recommended to use¬†`titleTemplate`¬†in the¬†`app.vue`¬†file to add a dynamic title, which is then applied to all routes of your Nuxt app.\n\n### Use your own cache keys\n\n`useAsyncData` auto-generates generates a key for cache. But the autogenerated key only takes into account the file and line where¬†`useAsyncData`¬†is invoked, and so it is recommended to always create your own key to avoid unwanted behaviour, if you are creating your own custom composable that is wrapping¬†`useAsyncData`. [Data fetching ¬∑ Get Started with Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/data-fetching#useasyncdata)\n\nRecommended ‚úÖ\n```\nconst id = ref(1)\n\nconst { data, error } = await useAsyncData(`user:${id.value}`, () =\u003e {\n  return myGetFunction('users', { id: id.value })\n})\n```\n\n\n# When to use $fetch, useFetch, useAsyncData\n\nThe¬†`useFetch`¬†composable is meant to be invoked in setup method or called directly at the top level of a function in lifecycle hooks, otherwise you should use¬†[`$fetch`¬†method](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/data-fetching#fetch).\n\n### [Minimize payload size](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/data-fetching#minimize-payload-size)\n\nRecommendation ‚úÖ\n\nThe¬†`pick`¬†option helps you to minimize the payload size stored in your HTML document by only selecting the fields that you want returned from the composables.\n\n```\n\u003cscript setup lang=\"ts\"\u003e\n/* only pick the fields used in your template */\nconst { data: mountain } = await useFetch('/api/mountains/everest', { pick: ['title', 'description'] })\n\u003c/script\u003e\n\n\u003ctemplate\u003e\n  \u003ch1\u003e{{ mountain.title }}\u003c/h1\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e{{ mountain.description }}\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/template\u003e\n```\n\nIf you need more control or map over several objects, you can use the¬†`transform`¬†function to alter the result of the query.\n\n```\nconst { data: mountains } = await useFetch('/api/mountains', { \n  transform: (mountains) =\u003e {\n    return mountains.map(mountain =\u003e ({ title: mountain.title, description: mountain.description }))\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n#### [Refresh and execute](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/data-fetching#refresh-and-execute)\n\nIf you want to fetch or refresh data manually, use the¬†`execute`¬†or¬†`refresh`¬†function provided by the composables.\n\n```\n\u003cscript setup lang=\"ts\"\u003e\nconst { data, error, execute, refresh } = await useFetch('/api/users')\n\u003c/script\u003e\n\n\u003ctemplate\u003e\n  \u003cdiv\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003e{{ data }}\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003cbutton @click=\"refresh\"\u003eRefresh data\u003c/button\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/template\u003e\n```\n\nRecommendation ‚úÖ\n\nThe¬†`execute`¬†function is an alias for¬†`refresh`¬†that works in exactly the same way but is more semantic for cases when the fetch is¬†[not immediate](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/data-fetching#not-immediate).\n\n### [Defining components](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/data-fetching#options-api-support)\n\nUsing¬†`\u003cscript setup lang=\"ts\"\u003e`¬†is the recommended way of declaring Vue components in Nuxt 3.\n\n### Use of Ref\n\nAvoid ‚ùå\nNever define¬†`const state = ref()`¬†outside of¬†`\u003cscript setup\u003e`¬†or¬†`setup()`¬†function.  \nSuch state will be shared across all users visiting your website and can lead to memory leaks!\n\nRecommended ‚úÖ\nInstead use¬†`const useX = () =\u003e useState('x')`\n\n## [Layout and Transition](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/components/nuxt-layout#layout-and-transition)\n\n`\u003cNuxtLayout /\u003e`¬†renders incoming content via¬†`\u003cslot /\u003e`, which is then wrapped around Vue‚Äôs¬†`\u003cTransition /\u003e`¬†component to activate layout transition. For this to work as expected, it is recommended that¬†`\u003cNuxtLayout /\u003e`¬†is¬†**not**¬†the root element of the page component.\n\n```\n\u003ctemplate\u003e\n  \u003cdiv\u003e\n    \u003cNuxtLayout name=\"custom\"\u003e\n      \u003ctemplate #header\u003e Some header template content. \u003c/template\u003e\n    \u003c/NuxtLayout\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/template\u003e\n```\n\nRecommendation ‚úÖ\n```\n\u003ctime :title=\"toTitleDate(date)\" :datetime=\"date\"\u003e\n  {{ formatDate(date) }}\n\u003c/time\u003e\n```\n\n\n\nFunctions called inside binding expressions will be called every time the component updates, so they should¬†**not**¬†have any side effects, such as changing data or triggering asynchronous operations.","lastmodified":"2023-11-03T13:28:26.399323391Z","tags":[]},"/nuxt/Paying-Attention-to-detail":{"title":"Nuxt - Paying attention to detail","content":"In this note, I will just jot down a few points that are easy to overlook while developing a Nuxt application.\n\nMy focus is on a server side rendered website, as I am [[Learning Nuxt 3|Learning Nuxt 3 for an SSR project]].
