Helps me center in the morning. Focus on working harder. Better the day before, quickly churning out more and more work, and following all these will make me strong. This song just pumps up energy in me.\n\n**Jiggle Jiggle**\n-_Louis Theroux_\n\nI love Louis Theroux. Plus I like this song. This is where I am in my journey right now. My money jiggle jiggle at the moment, but I would like for it to wiggle wiggle. It is a rap but a moral one, you don't come across such songs daily. The way Louis denied using the word bit*h in the song, speaks a lot to me about him. I like him and the song.

One unified planet, no difference between one human to the other. üíï\n\n**The Banjo Beat**\n-_Hayasa G_\n\nA song which pumps up more energy into me. I need energy boosters at the start of the day, so that I can keep on going through the day. This is one of them.\n\n**Stronger**\n-_Kanye West_\n\nMore like a remix version of my first anthem, Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger. I like the beats. I just like the sound of this song. I don't really care much about the rap part by Ye.\n\n**Still D.R.E**\n-_Snoop Dogg_\n\nThis is a classic song played in a lot of EDM concerts, this song just brings more energy as I like the beat. Rap is not as per my taste, it is just the music that I love.\n\n\n**I've Grown**\n-_Sofasound_\n\nThis is a slow song, the only one, just after pumping up so much energy into my mind, I like to bring it down a notch so that I can sustain the booster I got from the other songs preceding this one. It is a nice soft song. Again I don't know the lyrics of this one.

Oh yes! If you use the same password everywhere, let me tell you my friend, it is quite easy to hack your account.\n\nBreach happens on site A, leads to you getting hacked on other websites.\n\n\u003e I used to use the same password everywhere in the good old days. Came across [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)  and it revealed how many breaches my email has been part of, instantly started using password manager.\n\u003e \n\u003e A few years later I received a spam email, and it contained my old breached password, and they were trying to blackmail me to send them bitcoins. But I had already made a move from that password by then. üôÉ\n\n1Password's integrations are amazing! There's also developer API to connect and get secrets from the password store. I can store all my secrets in there and serve up the secrets right to my applications. No need to set up [Vault by HashiCorp](https://www.vaultproject.io/), at least for simple hacks.\n\nSome Alternatives,\n\nLastPass has been part of a breach lately. A security company going through a breach is not acceptable. I have used it in the past when it was free, but I don't think the integrations are as good as 1Password's and so I chose 1Password.\n\nApple's Keychain is good, but only if you are heavily integrated into the Apple ecosystem. It doesn't have an authenticator, and great out of the box integrations with browsers. But it is free (you are paying the premium for apple devices though ü§´)!\n\n# Github Copilot ü¶æ\n\nIf you are heavily integrated into VSCode as I am, then it is a must-buy subscription.\n\nChatGPT is much more powerful, but ChatGPT requires you to context switch from your IDE to browser, not very convenient. \n\nThe recent launch of CopilotX is revolutionary. 90% of my code is being written by Copilot nowadays. With CopilotX you have access to a ChatGPT like interface with a click of a shortcut. CopilotX knows the file that you are coming from and if you ask it some question, it provides answer based on the context you came in from.\n\nYou are bound to be surprised! ü§Ø\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-25T18:49:45.628127067Z","tags":[]},"/Training-My-First-AI-Model":{"title":"Training my first AI Model ü§ñ","content":"\nLet me take you on a journey through training of an AI model.\n\n# Problem Statement\n\nI am building [[Conversation Copilot]], one of the features I am targeting in v1 is tracking of followup on a message.\n\nAt times, you need to follow up on messages, let's say I had a conversation with my manager.\n\n\u003e Rhitik: Summer is coming, can we install a water cooler installed at the premises?\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e Roshan:  Let me check with some vendors and get back to you.\n\u003e *crickets* end of the day passes\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e ü¶ó *crickets* ü¶ó \n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e summer arrives\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e Rhitik: Hey Rosh, do we have any update on the water cooler conversation?\n\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e Roshan: Oh shucks totally forgot about it.
